# Written Analysis

### Effect of Budget
- A higher budget per student did not yield higher passing rates/testing scores. The higher the budget per student, the lower the passing rates/testing scores.  
- This trend is noticeable across the passing rates and test scores, with math observing the effects more than reading.
- Oddly, the budget per student of each school not affecting the passing rates/testing scores is not what one may expect. One may assume that the higher the per-student budget, the more resources and tools students have to achieve higher test scores/passing rates. This leads us to believe that there is another factor that is more influential in test scores/passing rates than the budget allotted to each student.

### Effect of School Type
- Charter school students tend to outperform the district schools across the board, especially in math and % of overall passing. 
- The district versus charter school outcomes are less surprising than the outcomes based on budget per student. 
- Generally, a charter school has around a 90% overall passing rate while a district school has around a 50% overall passing rate. This is a stark jump that would prompt more research into the differences between district and charter schools that lead to this outcome.

### Effect of School Size
- Schools with large student counts (2,000 students +) tend to have lower passing rates/testing scores than medium and small school bins (2,000 or fewer students). 
- The medium-sized schools appear to have slightly better outcomes than the small school category.
- This factor seems to go hand-in-hand with the charter vs. district school finding previously noted because charter schools tend to be smaller than district schools.

### Effect of Grade 
- The outcomes of passing rates/testing seem fairly even across grades with most of the variation being from school to school. 
- Again, this confirms that the key factors in determining a school's passing rates/testing scores lie with a difference between schools, not grade level. 

# Final Thoughts
### Limitations
- While we can make assumptions about what may cause these results, such as large schools having less one-on-one time with individual students, etc. We would need to have more data to make an educated statement on what is causing the outcomes in this analysis. 
- Additional metrics could be: Student to teacher ratios, number of learning resources, teacher credentials, etc. 
### Final Observation
- Based on this data, it can be determined that if a school is a medium-sized charter school with a per-student budget of less than $585, they would have the highest likelihood of observing high passing rates/testing scores.
